\# 🐍 Python Learning Journey



Welcome! I created this repository to help you get started with Python.



This isn't just a boring list of code; it's a step-by-step guide I put together to help you go from "Hello World" to building actual projects.



\## 🚀 Getting Started



Before you run any code, make sure you have the basics set up.



\### 1. Install Python

Make sure you have Python installed.

\* \*\*Check your version:\*\* Open your terminal/command prompt and type:

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   python --version

&nbsp;   # OR if you are on Windows and have multiple versions:

&nbsp;   py --version

&nbsp;   ```

\* \*Note: This tutorial is written for Python 3.10+, but it works great with the new Python 3.14!\*



\### 2. VS Code (Recommended)

I recommend using \*\*Visual Studio Code\*\* to edit these files. It makes reading code much easier.

\* Install the "Python" extension by Microsoft inside VS Code.

\## 📚 How to Use This Repo



I've organized the code into numbered folders so you can follow a logical path.



\### The Curriculum



\* \*\*📂 01\_Basics\*\*

&nbsp;   \* `hello\_world.py`: Your first script.

&nbsp;   \* `variables.py`: Understanding how to store data.

&nbsp;   \* `math\_stuff.py`: Basic numbers and operations.

\* \*\*📂 02\_Control\_Flow\*\*

&nbsp;   \* `if\_else.py`: Making decisions in code.

&nbsp;   \* `loops.py`: Repeating tasks (For and While loops).

\* \*\*📂 03\_Data\_Structures\*\*

&nbsp;   \* `lists\_and\_dicts.py`: How to manage groups of data.

\* \*\*📂 04\_Functions\*\*

&nbsp;   \* `my\_functions.py`: Writing reusable blocks of code.

\* \*\*📂 05\_Mini\_Projects\*\*
