# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome! I created this repository to help you get started with Python.

This isn't just a boring list of code; it's a step-by-step guide I put together to help you go from "Hello World" to building actual projects.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before you run any code, make sure you have the basics set up.

### 1. Install Python
Make sure you have Python installed.
* **Check your version:** Open your terminal/command prompt and type:
    ```bash
    python --version
    # OR if you are on Windows and have multiple versions:
    py --version
    ```
* *Note: This tutorial is written for Python 3.10+, but it works great with the new Python 3.14!*

### 2. VS Code (Recommended)
I recommend using **Visual Studio Code** to edit these files. It makes reading code much easier.
* Install the "Python" extension by Microsoft inside VS Code.

## 📚 How to Use This Repo

I've organized the code into numbered folders so you can follow a logical path.

### The Curriculum

* **📂 01_Basics**
    * `hello_world.py`: Your first script.
    * `variables.py`: Understanding how to store data.
    * `math_stuff.py`: Basic numbers and operations.
* **📂 02_Control_Flow**
    * `if_else.py`: Making decisions in code.
    * `loops.py`: Repeating tasks (For and While loops).
* **📂 03_Data_Structures**
    * `lists_and_dicts.py`: How to manage groups of data.
* **📂 04_Functions**
    * `my_functions.py`: Writing reusable blocks of code.
* **📂 05_Mini_Projects**
    * `calculator.py`: A simple command-line calculator.
    * `guessing_game.py`: A random number game.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Code

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the folder you want to run (e.g., `cd 01_Basics`).
3.  Run the file:

```bash
python variables.py
